# Safety Pilot Model Deployment Public Dataset

## Introduction

This data were collected during the Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD). The data sets that these entities will provide include basic safety messages (BSM), vehicle trajectories, and various driver-vehicle interaction data, as well as contextual data that describes the circumstances under which the Model Deployment data was collected. Large portion of the data contained in this environment is obtained from on board vehicle devices and roadside units.

This legacy dataset was created before data.transportation.gov and is only currently available via the attached file(s). Please contact the dataset owner if there is a need for users to work with this data using the data.transportation.gov analysis features (online viewing, API, graphing, etc.) and the USDOT will consider modifying the dataset to fully integrate in data.transportation.gov.

Data provided by U.S. Department of Transportationâ€™s (USDOT) Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Joint Program Office (JPO).
